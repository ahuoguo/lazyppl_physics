## Installation

The system uses Haskell stack.
You need to [install stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/v1.1.2/install_and_upgrade/) first if you want to use the system in the
standard way.

To build, type
``stack build``.
This may take some time (>1 hour) if it is your first time ever using stack.

To run, type
``stack run`` or ``stack run physics-exe``
